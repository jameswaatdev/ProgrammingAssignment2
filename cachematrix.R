# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
# Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
# For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
# For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
