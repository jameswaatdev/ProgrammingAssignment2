#Caching the Mean of a Vector
#In this example we introduce the  <<-  operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment. 
#Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.

#The first function,  makeVector  creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
#1. set the value of the vector
#2. get the value of the vector
#3. set the value of the mean
#4. get the value of the mean
makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
